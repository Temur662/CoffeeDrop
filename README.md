# ☕ CoffeeDrop - The Universal Cafe Loyalty App  

## 📖 Backstory  

Imagine you're a **frequent cafe visitor**, and each shop has its own **loyalty program** that you are automatically signed up for upon purchase.  
Now, you're stuck at **level 1** in **seven different loyalty programs**, unable to fully benefit from any of them.  

What if you could **earn points** on every coffee purchase and redeem them at **any cafe** instead of being locked into a single shop?  

With **CoffeeDrop**, you get **double rewards** by joining both **individual cafe programs** and the **CoffeeDrop platform**.
